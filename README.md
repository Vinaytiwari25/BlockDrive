BlockDrive is a decentralized platform that makes securely uploading and sharing images simple and safe, all thanks to blockchain technology. Instead of relying on traditional cloud services, which can be vulnerable to data breaches or outages, BlockDrive uses the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to store images in a decentralized way. This means your files are scattered across a global network of computers, ensuring they’re protected from tampering and always accessible.

The cool part? The entire system is powered by smart contracts written in Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. These smart contracts give users complete control over who can access their images. You can easily grant or revoke access to specific people, knowing that everything is tracked transparently on the blockchain. Plus, every image uploaded gets a unique cryptographic hash, which is stored on the blockchain, proving that you’re the owner and that the file hasn’t been altered.

The platform's front-end, built with React, is user-friendly and intuitive. You can upload images, manage permissions, and view your files all in one place. No need for complicated steps or extra technical knowledge—everything is straightforward and secure.

Key Features:

Decentralized Storage: Your images are stored on IPFS, not in a centralized server, which means they’re secure, tamper-proof, and always accessible.
Smart Contract Security: Ownership and access control are handled by Ethereum smart contracts, giving you full control over who can view or download your images.
Easy-to-Use Interface: With a clean and simple React front-end, managing your uploads and permissions feels effortless.
Complete Ownership: Each file gets a unique, unchangeable hash stored on the blockchain, proving your ownership and ensuring the file’s integrity.
Technologies Involved:

Solidity for the smart contracts that handle ownership and access.
React for the easy-to-use front-end interface.
IPFS for decentralized, secure storage.
Ethereum for transparent access management through smart contracts.
With BlockDrive, you’re in control of your digital assets—no middlemen, no centralized servers, just secure and easy image storage and sharing.
